## Overview

The OpenCC SRT Converter utilizes the OpenCC library to perform conversions between Simplified and Traditional Chinese. This Docker image encapsulates all necessary dependencies.

## Docker Image Usage

To use the OpenCC SRT Converter Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the Docker Image**:
   You can pull the latest version of the image from Docker Hub with the following command:
    
```docker pull spawnpeekboi/opencc-srt-converter```    
    
1. **Run the Docker Container**:
Use the following command to run the converter. Replace `/path/to/media` with the path to your directory containing SRT files and `/path/to/data` with your desired backup/log directory:

```docker run --rm -v /path/to/media:/media -v /path/to/data:/data spawnpeekboi/opencc-srt-converter```    
    
1. **Example Command**:
Hereâ€™s an example of running the converter with a sample directory:

```docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/srt_files:/media -v $(pwd)/backups:/data spawnpeekboi/opencc-srt-converter```    

This command will convert all SRT files in `srt_files`, back them up in `backups`, and replace them with their Traditional Chinese versions.

## Docker Compose Setup

You can also use Docker Compose to simplify running the OpenCC SRT Converter. Below is an example `docker-compose.yml` file you can use:

```
version: '3.8'

services:
  opencc-srt-converter:
    image: spawnpeekboi/opencc-srt-converter
    volumes:
      - /path/to/media:/media  # Path to your SRT files
      - /path/to/data:/data     # Path for backups and logs
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Building the Image

If you want to build the Docker image from source, you can do so by cloning this repository and running the following command in the project directory:

```docker build -t opencc-srt-converter .```
